# Setting up load scenarios

A load scenario is defined in a JSON file with a number of sections.

<details>
<summary>connectionSettings</summary>

## Connection settings section

This section of the JSON file contains connection information.

JSON Web Token (JWT), an open standard for creation of access tokens, or WebSocket can be used for authentication. When using JWT, the private key must be available in the path defined by `jwtsettings.keypath`.

* `mode`: Authentication mode
    * `jwt`: JSON Web Token
    * `ws`: WebSocket
* `jwtsettings`: (JWT only) Settings for the JWT connection.
  * `keypath`: Local path to the JWT key file.
  * `jwtheader`: JWT headers as an escaped JSON string. Custom headers to be added to the JWT header.
  * `claims`: JWT claims as an escaped JSON string.
  * `alg`: The signing method used for the JWT. Defaults to `RS512`, if omitted.
      * For keyfiles in RSA format, supports `RS256`, `RS384` or `RS512`.
      * For keyfiles in EC format, supports `ES256`, `ES384` or `ES512`.
* `wssettings`: (WebSocket only) Settings for the WebSocket connection.
* `server`: Qlik Sense host.
* `virtualproxy`: Prefix for the virtual proxy that handles the virtual users.
* `rawurl`: Define the connect URL manually instead letting the `openapp` action do it. **Note**: The protocol must be `wss://` or `ws://`.
* `port`: Set another port than default (`80` for http and `443` for https).
* `security`: Use TLS (SSL) (`true` / `false`).
* `allowuntrusted`: Allow untrusted (for example, self-signed) certificates (`true` / `false`). Defaults to `false`, if omitted.
* `appext`: Replace `app` in the connect URL for the `openapp` action. Defaults to `app`, if omitted.
* `headers`: Headers to use in requests.

### Examples

#### JWT authentication

```json
"connectionSettings": {
    "server": "myserver.com",
    "mode": "jwt",
    "virtualproxy": "jwt",
    "security": true,
    "allowuntrusted": false,
    "jwtsettings": {
        "keypath": "mock.pem",
        "claims": "{\"user\":\"{{.UserName}}\",\"directory\":\"{{.Directory}}\"}"
    }
}
```

* `jwtsettings`:

The strings for `reqheader`, `jwtheader` and `claims` are processed as a GO template where the `User` struct can be used as data:
```golang
struct {
	UserName  string
	Password  string
	Directory string
	}
```
There is also support for the `time.Now` method using the function `now`.

* `jwtheader`:

The entries for message authentication code algorithm, `alg`, and token type, `typ`, are added automatically to the header and should not be included.
    
**Example:** To add a key ID header, `kid`, add the following string:
```json
{
	"jwtheader": "{\"kid\":\"myKeyId\"}"
}
```

* `claims`:

**Example:** For on-premise JWT authentication (with the user and directory set as keys in the QMC), add the following string:
```json
{
	"claims": "{\"user\": \"{{.UserName}}\",\"directory\": \"{{.Directory}}\"}"
}
```
**Example:** To add the time at which the JWT was issued, `iat` ("issued at"), add the following string:
```json
{
	"claims": "{\"iat\":{{now.Unix}}"
}
```
**Example:** To add the expiration time, `exp`, with 5 hours expiration (time.Now uses nanoseconds), add the following string:
```json
{
	"claims": "{\"exp\":{{(now.Add 18000000000000).Unix}}}"
}
```

#### Static header authentication

```json
connectionSettings": {
	"server": "myserver.com",
	"mode": "ws",
	"security": true,
	"virtualproxy" : "header",
	"headers" : {
		"X-Qlik-User-Header" : "{{.UserName}}"
}
```

<summary>loginSettings</summary>

## Login settings section

This section of the JSON file contains information on the login settings.

* `type`: Type of login request
    * `prefix`: Add a prefix (specified by the `prefix` setting below) to the username, so that it will be `prefix_{session}`.
    * `userlist`: List of users as specified by the `userList` setting below.
    * `none`: Do not add a prefix to the username, so that it will be `{session}`.
* `settings`: 
    * `userList`: List of users for the `userlist` login request type. Directory and password can be specified per user or outside the list of usernames, which means that they are inherited by all users.
  * `prefix`: Prefix to add to the username, so that it will be `prefix_{session}`.
  * `directory`: Directory to set for the users.

### Examples

#### Prefix login request type

```json
"loginSettings": {
   "type": "prefix",
   "settings": {
       "directory": "anydir",

    "type": "userlist",
    "settings": {
      "userList": [
        {
          "username": "sim1@myhost.example",
          "directory": "anydir1",
          "password": "MyPassword1"
        },
        {
          "username": "sim2@myhost.example"
        }
      ],
      "directory": "anydir2",

      * `minduration`: Add a time buffer if the iteration duration is less than `duration`.
  * `duration`: Duration of the time buffer (for example, `500ms`, `30s` or `1m10s`). Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `Âµs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, and `h`.
* `instance`: Instance number for this instance. Use different instance numbers when running the same script in multiple instances to make sure the randomization is different in each instance. Defaults to 1.
* `settings`: 
  * `executionTime`: Test execution time (seconds). The sessions are disconnected when the specified time has elapsed. Allowed values are positive integers. `-1` means an infinite execution time.
  * `iterations`: Number of iterations for each 'concurrent' user to repeat. Allowed values are positive integers. `-1` means an infinite number of iterations.
  * `rampupDelay`: Time delay (seconds) scheduled in between each concurrent user during the startup period.
  * `concurrentUsers`: Number of concurrent users to simulate. Allowed values are positive integers.
  * `reuseUsers`: 
      * `true`: Every iteration for each concurrent user uses the same user and session.
      * `false`: Every iteration for each concurrent user uses a new user and session. The total number of users is the product of `concurrentusers` and `iterations`.
  * `onlyinstanceseed`: Disable session part of randomization seed. Defaults to `false`, if omitted.
      * `true`: All users and sessions have the same randomization sequence, which only changes if the `instance` flag is changed.
      * `false`: Normal randomization sequence, dependent on both the `instance` parameter and the current user session.

### Example

```json
"scheduler": {
   "type": "simple",
   "settings": {
       "executiontime": 120,
       "iterations": -1,

</details><details>
<summary>randomaction</summary>

## RandomAction action

Randomly select other actions to perform. This meta-action can be used as a starting point for your testing efforts, to simplify script authoring or to add background load.

`randomaction` accepts a list of action types between which to randomize. An execution of `randomaction` executes one or more of the listed actions (as determined by the `iterations` parameter), randomly chosen by a weighted probability. If nothing else is specified, each action has a default random mode that is used. An override is done by specifying one or more parameters of the original action.

Each action executed by `randomaction` is followed by a customizable `thinktime`.

**Note:** The recommended way to use this action is to prepend it with an `openapp` and a `changesheet` action as this ensures that a sheet is always in context.

### Settings

* `actions`: List of actions from which to randomly pick an action to execute. Each item has a number of possible parameters.
  * `type`: Type of action
      * `thinktime`: See the `thinktime` action.
      * `sheetobjectselection`: Make random selections within objects visible on the current sheet. See the `select` action.
      * `changesheet`: See the `changesheet` action.
      * `clearall`: See the `clearall` action.
  * `weight`: The probabilistic weight of the action, specified as an integer. This number is proportional to the likelihood of the specified action, and is used as a weight in a uniform random selection.
  * `overrides`: (optional) Static overrides to the action. The overrides can include any or all of the settings from the original action, as determined by the `type` field. If nothing is specified, the default values are used.
* `thinktimesettings`: Settings for the `thinktime` action, which is automatically inserted after every randomized action.
  * `type`: Type of think time
      * `static`: Static think time, defined by `delay`.
      * `uniform`: Random think time with uniform distribution, defined by `mean` and `dev`.
  * `delay`: Delay (seconds), used with type `static`.
  * `mean`: Mean (seconds), used with type `uniform`.
  * `dev`: Deviation (seconds), used with type `uniform`.
* `iterations`: Number of random actions to perform.

### Random action defaults

The following default values are used for the different actions:

* `thinktime`: Mirrors the configuration of `thinktimesettings`
* `sheetobjectselection`:

```json
{
     "settings": 
     {
         "id": <UNIFORMLY RANDOMIZED>,

## Session variables

This section describes the session variables that can be used with some of the actions.

<details>
<summary><a name="session_variables"></a>Session variables</summary>

Some action parameters support session variables. A session variable is defined by putting the variable, prefixed by a dot, within double curly brackets, such as `{{.UserName}}`.

The following session variables are supported in actions:

* `UserName`: The simulated username. This is not the same as the authenticated user, but rather how the username was defined by [Login settings](#login_settings).  
* `Session`: The enumeration of the currently simulated session.
* `Thread`: The enumeration of the currently simulated "thread" or "concurrent user".

The following variable is supported in the filename of the log file:

* `ConfigFile`: The filename of the config file, without file extension.

The following functions are supported:

* `now`: Evaluates Golang [time.Now()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/). 
* `hostname`: Hostname of the local machine.
* `timestamp`: Timestamp in `yyyyMMddhhmmss` format.
* `uuid`: Generate an uuid.

### Example
```json
{
    "action": "ElasticCreateApp",
    "label": "Create new app",
    "settings": {
        "title": "CreateApp {{.Thread}}-{{.Session}} ({{.UserName}})",
        "stream": "mystream",
        "groups": [
            "mygroup"

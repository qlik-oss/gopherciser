# Setting up load scenarios

A load scenario is defined in a JSON file with a number of sections.


## Example

* [Load scenario example](./examples/configuration_example.json)

<details>
<summary>connectionSettings</summary>

## Connection settings section

This section of the JSON file contains connection information.

JSON Web Token (JWT), an open standard for creation of access tokens, or WebSocket can be used for authentication. When using JWT, the private key must be available in the path defined by `jwtsettings.keypath`.

* `mode`: Authentication mode
    * `jwt`: JSON Web Token
    * `ws`: WebSocket
* `jwtsettings`: (JWT only) Settings for the JWT connection.
  * `keypath`: Local path to the JWT key file.
  * `jwtheader`: JWT headers as an escaped JSON string. Custom headers to be added to the JWT header.
  * `claims`: JWT claims as an escaped JSON string.
  * `alg`: The signing method used for the JWT. Defaults to `RS512`, if omitted.
      * For keyfiles in RSA format, supports `RS256`, `RS384` or `RS512`.
      * For keyfiles in EC format, supports `ES256`, `ES384` or `ES512`.
* `wssettings`: (WebSocket only) Settings for the WebSocket connection.
* `server`: Qlik Sense host.
* `virtualproxy`: Prefix for the virtual proxy that handles the virtual users.
* `rawurl`: Define the connect URL manually instead letting the `openapp` action do it. **Note**: The protocol must be `wss://` or `ws://`.
* `port`: Set another port than default (`80` for http and `443` for https).
* `security`: Use TLS (SSL) (`true` / `false`).
* `allowuntrusted`: Allow untrusted (for example, self-signed) certificates (`true` / `false`). Defaults to `false`, if omitted.
* `appext`: Replace `app` in the connect URL for the `openapp` action. Defaults to `app`, if omitted.
* `headers`: Headers to use in requests.

### Examples

#### JWT authentication

```json
"connectionSettings": {
    "server": "myserver.com",
    "mode": "jwt",
    "virtualproxy": "jwt",
    "security": true,
    "allowuntrusted": false,
    "jwtsettings": {
        "keypath": "mock.pem",
        "claims": "{\"user\":\"{{.UserName}}\",\"directory\":\"{{.Directory}}\"}"
    }
}
```

* `jwtsettings`:

The strings for `reqheader`, `jwtheader` and `claims` are processed as a GO template where the `User` struct can be used as data:
```golang
struct {
	UserName  string
	Password  string
	Directory string
	}
```
There is also support for the `time.Now` method using the function `now`.

* `jwtheader`:

The entries for message authentication code algorithm, `alg`, and token type, `typ`, are added automatically to the header and should not be included.
    
**Example:** To add a key ID header, `kid`, add the following string:
```json
{
	"jwtheader": "{\"kid\":\"myKeyId\"}"
}
```

* `claims`:

**Example:** For on-premise JWT authentication (with the user and directory set as keys in the QMC), add the following string:
```json
{
	"claims": "{\"user\": \"{{.UserName}}\",\"directory\": \"{{.Directory}}\"}"
}
```
**Example:** To add the time at which the JWT was issued, `iat` ("issued at"), add the following string:
```json
{
	"claims": "{\"iat\":{{now.Unix}}"
}
```
**Example:** To add the expiration time, `exp`, with 5 hours expiration (time.Now uses nanoseconds), add the following string:
```json
{
	"claims": "{\"exp\":{{(now.Add 18000000000000).Unix}}}"
}
```

#### Static header authentication

```json
connectionSettings": {
	"server": "myserver.com",
	"mode": "ws",
	"security": true,
	"virtualproxy" : "header",
	"headers" : {
		"X-Qlik-User-Header" : "{{.UserName}}"
}
```

<summary>hooks</summary>

## Hooks section

This section contains the possibility to define hooks, which will send requests to a defined endpoint before and after a test execution.

### Example

#### Send a request to slack that a test is starting.

```json
"hooks": {
    "preexecute": {
        "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXX/YYYYYYYYYYY/ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ",
        "method": "POST",
        "payload": "{ \"text\": \"Running test with {{ .Scheduler.ConcurrentUsers }} concurrent users and {{ .Scheduler.Iterations }} iterations towards {{ .ConnectionSettings.Server }}.\"}",
        "contenttype": "application/json"
    },
    "postexecute": {
        "url": "https://hooks.slack.com/services/XXXXXXXXX/YYYYYYYYYYY/ZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZZ",
        "method": "POST",
        "payload": "{ \"text\": \"Test finished with {{ .Counters.Errors }} errors and {{ .Counters.Warnings }} warnings. Total Sessions: {{ .Counters.Sessions }}\"}"
    }
}
```

This will send a message on test startup such as:

```text
Running test with 10 concurrent users and 2 iterations towards MyServer.com.
```

And a message on test finished such as:

```text
Test finished with 4 errors and 12 warnings. Total Sessions: 20.
```

#### Ask an endpoint before execution if test is ok to run

```json
"hooks": {
    "preexecute": {
        "url": "http://myserver:8080/oktoexecute",
        "method": "POST",
        "headers": [
            {
                "name" : "someheader",
                "value": "headervalue"
            }
        ],
        "payload": "{\"testID\": \"12345\",\"startAt\": \"{{now.Format \"2006-01-02T15:04:05Z07:00\"}}\"}",
        "extractors": [
            {
                "name": "oktorun",
                "path" : "/oktorun",
                "faillevel": "error",
                "validator" : {
                    "type": "bool",
                    "value": "true"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
```

This will POST a request to `http://myserver:8080/oktoexecute` with the body:

```json
{
    "testID": "12345",
    "startAt": "2021-05-06T08:00:00Z01:00"
}
```

For a test started at `2021-05-06T08:00:00` in timezone UTC+1.

Let's assume the response from this endpoint is:

```json
{
    "oktorun": false
}
```

The validator with path `/oktorun` will extract the value `false` and compare to the value defined in the validator, in this case `true`. Since the they are not equal the test will stop with error before starting exection.

<summary>loginSettings</summary>

## Login settings section

This section of the JSON file contains information on the login settings.

* `type`: Type of login request
    * `prefix`: Add a prefix (specified by the `prefix` setting below) to the username, so that it will be `prefix_{session}`.
    * `userlist`: List of users as specified by the `userList` setting below.
    * `fromfile`: List of users from a file with 1 user per row and the format `username;directory;password`
    * `none`: Do not add a prefix to the username, so that it will be `{session}`.
* `settings`: 
    * `userList`: List of users for the `userlist` login request type. Directory and password can be specified per user or outside the list of usernames, which means that they are inherited by all users.
    * `filename`: Path to file with users.
  * `prefix`: Prefix to add to the username, so that it will be `prefix_{session}`.
  * `directory`: Directory to set for the users.

### Examples

#### Prefix login request type

      }
    ],
    "directory": "anydir2",
    "password": "MyPassword2"
  }
}
```

#### Fromfile login request type

Reads a user list from file. 1 User per row of the and with the format `username;directory;password`. `directory` and `password` are optional, if none are defined for a user it will use the default values on settings (i.e. `defaultdir` and `defaultpassword`). If the used authentication type doesn't use `directory` or `password` these can be omitted.

Definition with default values:

```json
"loginSettings": {
  "type": "fromfile",
  "settings": {
    "filename": "./myusers.txt",
    "directory": "defaultdir",
    "password": "defaultpassword"
  }
}
```

Definition without default values:

```json
"loginSettings": {
  "type": "fromfile",
  "settings": {
    "filename": "./myusers.txt"
  }
}
```

This is a valid format of a file.

```text
testuser1
testuser2;myspecialdirectory
testuser3;;somepassword
testuser4;specialdir;anotherpassword
testuser5;;A;d;v;a;n;c;e;d;;P;a;s;s;w;o;r;d;
```

*testuser1* will get default `directory` and `password`, *testuser3* and *testuser5* will get default `directory`.

<summary>disconnectenvironment</summary>

## DisconnectEnvironment action

Disconnect from an environment. This action will disconnect open websockets towards sense and events. The action is not needed for most scenarios, however if a scenario mixes different types of environmentsor uses custom actions towards external environment, it should be used directly after the last action towards the environment.

Since the action also disconnects any open websocket to Sense apps, it does not need to be preceeded with a `disconnectapp` action.


### Example

```json
{
    "label": "Disconnect from environment",
    "action" : "disconnectenvironment"
}
```

<details>
<summary>randomaction</summary>

## RandomAction action

Randomly select other actions to perform. This meta-action can be used as a starting point for your testing efforts, to simplify script authoring or to add background load.

`randomaction` accepts a list of action types between which to randomize. An execution of `randomaction` executes one or more of the listed actions (as determined by the `iterations` parameter), randomly chosen by a weighted probability. If nothing else is specified, each action has a default random mode that is used. An override is done by specifying one or more parameters of the original action.

Each action executed by `randomaction` is followed by a customizable `thinktime`.

**Note:** The recommended way to use this action is to prepend it with an `openapp` and a `changesheet` action as this ensures that a sheet is always in context.

* `actions`: List of actions from which to randomly pick an action to execute. Each item has a number of possible parameters.
  * `type`: Type of action
      * `thinktime`: See the `thinktime` action.
      * `sheetobjectselection`: Make random selections within objects visible on the current sheet. See the `select` action.
      * `changesheet`: See the `changesheet` action.
      * `clearall`: See the `clearall` action.
  * `weight`: The probabilistic weight of the action, specified as an integer. This number is proportional to the likelihood of the specified action, and is used as a weight in a uniform random selection.
  * `overrides`: (optional) Static overrides to the action. The overrides can include any or all of the settings from the original action, as determined by the `type` field. If nothing is specified, the default values are used.
* `thinktimesettings`: Settings for the `thinktime` action, which is automatically inserted after every randomized action.
  * `type`: Type of think time
      * `static`: Static think time, defined by `delay`.
      * `uniform`: Random think time with uniform distribution, defined by `mean` and `dev`.
  * `delay`: Delay (seconds), used with type `static`.
  * `mean`: Mean (seconds), used with type `uniform`.
  * `dev`: Deviation (seconds) from `mean` value, used with type `uniform`.
* `iterations`: Number of random actions to perform.

### Random action defaults

The following default values are used for the different actions:

* `thinktime`: Mirrors the configuration of `thinktimesettings`
* `sheetobjectselection`:

```json
{
     "settings": 
     {
         "id": <UNIFORMLY RANDOMIZED>,
         "type": "RandomFromAll",
         "min": 1,
         "max": 2,
         "accept": true
     }
}
```

* `changesheet`:

```json
{
     "settings": 
     {
         "id": <UNIFORMLY RANDOMIZED>
     }
}
```

* `clearall`:

```json
{
     "settings": 
     {
     }
}
```

<details>
<summary>select</summary>

## Select action

Select random values in an object.

See the [Limitations](README.md#limitations) section in the README.md file for limitations related to this action.
 
* `id`: ID of the object in which to select values.
* `type`: Selection type
    * `randomfromall`: Randomly select within all values of the symbol table.
    * `randomfromenabled`: Randomly select within the white and light grey values on the first data page.
    * `randomfromexcluded`: Randomly select within the dark grey values on the first data page.
    * `randomdeselect`: Randomly deselect values on the first data page.
    * `values`: Select specific element values, defined by `values` array.
* `accept`: Accept or abort selection after selection (only used with `wrap`) (`true` / `false`).
* `wrap`: Wrap selection with Begin / End selection requests (`true` / `false`).
* `min`: Minimum number of selections to make.
* `max`: Maximum number of selections to make.
* `dim`: Dimension / column in which to select.
* `values`: Array of element values to select when using selection type `values`. These are the element values for a selection, not the values seen by the user.

### Example

Randomly select among all the values in object `RZmvzbF`.

```json
{
     "label": "ListBox Year",
     "action": "Select",
     "settings": {
         "id": "RZmvzbF",
         "type": "RandomFromAll",
         "accept": true,
         "wrap": false,
         "min": 1,
         "max": 3,
         "dim": 0
     }
}
```

Randomly select among all the enabled values (a.k.a "white" values) in object `RZmvzbF`.

```json
{
     "label": "ListBox Year",
     "action": "Select",
     "settings": {
         "id": "RZmvzbF",
         "type": "RandomFromEnabled",
         "accept": true,
         "wrap": false,
         "min": 1,
         "max": 3,
         "dim": 0
     }
}
```

#### Statically selecting specific values

This example selects specific element values in object `RZmvzbF`. These are the values which can be seen in a selection when e.g. inspecting traffic, it is not the data values presented to the user. E.g. when loading a table in the following order by a Sense loadscript:

```
Beta
Alpha
Gamma
```

which might be presented to the user sorted as

```
Alpha
Beta
Gamma
```

The element values will be Beta=0, Alpha=1 and Gamma=2.

To statically select "Gamma" in this case:

```json
{
     "label": "Select Gammma",
     "action": "Select",
     "settings": {
         "id": "RZmvzbF",
         "type": "values",
         "accept": true,
         "wrap": false,
         "values" : [2],
         "dim": 0
     }
}
```

                    "value": "{{ .ScriptVars.BookmarkCounter | add 1}}"
                }
            }
        ]
    }
}
 ```

A more advanced example.

Create a bookmark "BookmarkX" for each iteration in a loop, and add this to an array "MyArrayVar". After the first `iterated` action this will look like "Bookmark1,Bookmark2,Bookmark3". The second `iterated` action then deletes these bookmarks using the created array.

Dissecting the first array construction action. The `join` command takes the elements `.ScriptVars.MyArrayVar` and joins them together into a string separated by the separtor `,`. So with an array of [ elem1 elem2 ] this becomes a string as `elem1,elem2`. The `if` statement checks if the value of `.ScriptVars.BookmarkCounter` is 0, if it is 0 (i.e. the first iteration) it sets the string to `Bookmark1`. If it is not 0, it executes the join command on .ScriptVars.MyArrayVar, on iteration 3, the result of this would be `Bookmark1,Bookmark2` then it appends the fixed string `,Bookmark`, so far the string is `Bookmark1,Bookmark2,Bookmark`. Lastly it takes the value of `.ScriptVars.BookmarkCounter`, which is now 2, and adds 1 too it and appends, making the entire string `Bookmark1,Bookmark2,Bookmark3`.

 ```json
{
    "action": "setscriptvar",

        "name": "BookmarkCounter",

## Session variables

This section describes the session variables that can be used with some of the actions.

<details>
<summary><a name="session_variables"></a>Session variables</summary>

Some action parameters support session variables. A session variable is defined by putting the variable, prefixed by a dot, within double curly brackets, such as `{{.UserName}}`.

The following session variables are supported in actions:

* `UserName`: The simulated username. This is not the same as the authenticated user, but rather how the username was defined by [Login settings](#login_settings).  
* `Session`: The enumeration of the currently simulated session.
* `Thread`: The enumeration of the currently simulated "thread" or "concurrent user".
* `ScriptVars`: A map containing script variables added by the action `setscriptvar`.

The following variable is supported in the filename of the log file:

* `ConfigFile`: The filename of the config file, without file extension.

The following functions are supported:

* `now`: Evaluates Golang [time.Now()](https://golang.org/pkg/time/). 
* `hostname`: Hostname of the local machine.
* `timestamp`: Timestamp in `yyyyMMddhhmmss` format.
* `uuid`: Generate an uuid.
* `env`: Retrieve a specific environment variable. Takes one argument - the name of the environment variable to expand.
* `add`: Adds two integer values together and outputs the sum. E.g. `{{ add 1 2 }}`.
* `join`: Joins array elements together to a string separated by defined separator. E.g. `{{ join .ScriptVars.MyArray \",\" }}`.

### Example

```json
{
    "label" : "Create bookmark",
    "action": "createbookmark",
    "settings": {
        "title": "my bookmark {{.Thread}}-{{.Session}} ({{.UserName}})",

<summary>scheduler</summary>

## Scheduler section

This section of the JSON file contains scheduler settings for the users in the load scenario.

* `type`: Type of scheduler
    * `simple`: Standard scheduler
* `iterationtimebuffer`: 
  * `mode`: Time buffer mode. Defaults to `nowait`, if omitted.
      * `nowait`: No time buffer in between the iterations.
      * `constant`: Add a constant time buffer after each iteration. Defined by `duration`.
      * `onerror`: Add a time buffer in case of an error. Defined by `duration`.
      * `minduration`: Add a time buffer if the iteration duration is less than `duration`.
  * `duration`: Duration of the time buffer (for example, `500ms`, `30s` or `1m10s`). Valid time units are `ns`, `us` (or `µs`), `ms`, `s`, `m`, and `h`.
* `instance`: Instance number for this instance. Use different instance numbers when running the same script in multiple instances to make sure the randomization is different in each instance. Defaults to 1.
* `reconnectsettings`: Settings for enabling re-connection attempts in case of unexpected disconnects.
  * `reconnect`: Enable re-connection attempts if the WebSocket is disconnected. Defaults to `false`.
  * `backoff`: Re-connection backoff scheme. Defaults to `[0.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0, 2.0]`, if left empty. An example backoff scheme could be `[0.0, 1.0, 10.0, 20.0]`:
      * `0.0`: If the WebSocket is disconnected, wait 0.0s before attempting to re-connect
      * `1.0`: If the previous attempt to re-connect failed, wait 1.0s before attempting again
      * `10.0`: If the previous attempt to re-connect failed, wait 10.0s before attempting again
      * `20.0`: If the previous attempt to re-connect failed, wait 20.0s before attempting again
* `maxerrors`: Break execution if max errors exceeded. 0 - Do not break. Defaults to 0.
* `settings`: 
  * `executionTime`: Test execution time (seconds). The sessions are disconnected when the specified time has elapsed. Allowed values are positive integers. `-1` means an infinite execution time.
  * `iterations`: Number of iterations for each 'concurrent' user to repeat. Allowed values are positive integers. `-1` means an infinite number of iterations.
  * `rampupDelay`: Time delay (seconds) scheduled in between each concurrent user during the startup period.
  * `concurrentUsers`: Number of concurrent users to simulate. Allowed values are positive integers.
  * `reuseUsers`: 
      * `true`: Every iteration for each concurrent user uses the same user and session.
      * `false`: Every iteration for each concurrent user uses a new user and session. The total number of users is the product of `concurrentusers` and `iterations`.
  * `onlyinstanceseed`: Disable session part of randomization seed. Defaults to `false`, if omitted.
      * `true`: All users and sessions have the same randomization sequence, which only changes if the `instance` flag is changed.
      * `false`: Normal randomization sequence, dependent on both the `instance` parameter and the current user session.

### Using `reconnectsettings`

If `reconnectsettings.reconnect` is enabled, the following is attempted:

1. Re-connect the WebSocket.
2. Get the currently opened app in the re-attached engine session.
3. Re-subscribe to the same object as before the disconnection.
4. If successful, the action during which the re-connect happened is logged as a successful action with `action` and `label` changed to `Reconnect(action)` and `Reconnect(label)`.
5. Restart the action that was executed when the disconnection occurred (unless it is a `thinktime` action, which will not be restarted).
6. Log an info row with info type `WebsocketReconnect` and with a semicolon-separated `details` section as follows: "success=`X`;attempts=`Y`;TimeSpent=`Z`"
    * `X`: True/false
    * `Y`: An integer representing the number of re-connection attempts
    * `Z`: The time spent re-connecting (ms)

### Example

Simple scheduler settings:

```json
"scheduler": {
   "type": "simple",
   "settings": {
       "executiontime": 120,
       "iterations": -1,
       "rampupdelay": 7.0,
       "concurrentusers": 10
   },
   "iterationtimebuffer" : {
       "mode": "onerror",
       "duration" : "5s"
   },
   "instance" : 2
}
```

Simple scheduler set to attempt re-connection in case of an unexpected WebSocket disconnection:
